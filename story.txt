Once there lived a fox. The fox had only one eye but he had great hearing power. Once the fox heard a vixen crying and it reached out and helped her out from her mysery. The vixen was happy and immediately fell in love with the fox, despite the fox having only one eye. They started living together and made babies. Now they live happily in Jumbo forest.
